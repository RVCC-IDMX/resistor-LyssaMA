# Resistor

This code is for a Resistor Calculator. A tool to help calculate the resistance value of a resistor based on its color bands.You can use it by inputting the colors of the bands on your resistor.

Color Code:

1st Band: First digit
2nd Band: Second digit
3rd Band: Multiplier (10 raised to the power of this number)
4th Band: Tolerance (optional, shows the tolerance of the resistor)
5th Band: Temperature coefficient (optional, indicates how the resistance changes with temperature)
